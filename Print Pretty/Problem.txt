Your manager gave you a text file with many lines of numbers to format and print. For each row of 3 space-separated doubles, 
format and print the numbers using the specifications in the Output Format section below.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer,T , the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines describes a test case as 3 space-separated floating-point numbers: A, B, and C, respectively.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
Each number will fit into a double.

Output Format:
For each test case, print 3 lines containing the formatted A, B, and C, respectively. Each A, B, and C must be formatted as follows:
A: Strip its decimal (i.e., truncate it) and print its hexadecimal representation (including the 0x prefix) in lower case letters.
B: Print it to a scale of 2 decimal places, preceded by a + or - sign (indicating if it's positive or negative), right justified, and left-padded 
   with underscores so that the printed result is exactly 15 characters wide.
C: Print it to a scale of exactly nine decimal places, expressed in scientific notation using upper case.

Sample Input:
1  
100.345 2006.008 2331.41592653498

Sample Output:
0x64             
_______+2006.01  
2.331415927E+03
Explanation

For the first line of output, (100)sub10 -> (64)sub16 (in reverse, 6 * 16^1 + 4 * 16^0 = (100)sub10).
The second and third lines of output are formatted as described in the Output Format section.
