Create two classes:

Rectangle:
The Rectangle class should have two data fields-width and height of int types. The class should have display() method, to print the width and 
height of the rectangle separated by space.

RectangleArea:
The RectangleArea class is derived from Rectangle class, i.e., it is the sub-class of Rectangle class. 
The class should have read_input() method, to read the values of width and height of the rectangle. 
The RectangleArea class should also overload the display() method to print the area (width * height) of the rectangle.

Input Format:
The first and only line of input contains two space separated integers denoting the width and height of the rectangle.

Constraints:
1 <= width,height <= 100

Output Format:
The output should consist of exactly two lines:
In the first line, print the width and height of the rectangle separated by space.
In the second line, print the area of the rectangle.

Sample Input:
10 5

Sample Output:
10 5
50

Explanation:
As, width = 10 and height = 5,so area = width * height = 50
